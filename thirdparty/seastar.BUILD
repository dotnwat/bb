## We set the following environment variables
## * ASAN_OPTIONS=disable_coredump=0:abort_on_error=1:detect_stack_use_after_return=1:verify_asan_link_order=0
##   By default ASan disables core dumps because they used to be
##   huge. This is no longer the case since the shadow memory is
##   excluded, so it is safe to enable them.
##   Also, by default, to make sure it works as expected, ASan
##   verifies if the ASan dynamic runtime is the first DSO in the
##   initial library list by calling dl_iterate_phdr(3). But
##   Seastar provides this symbol, and its implementation references
##   some static variables. So if Seastar is built as a shared
##   library, this causes a chicken and egg problem. In other words,
##   ASan is loaded first, and it tries to reference a symbol which
##   is in turn provided by another shared library which does not
##   necessarily ready its static variables yet. And this leads
##   to a segfault. So, we have to disable this check when
##   "BUILD_SHARED_LIBS" is enabled.
## * UBSAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1:abort_on_error=1
##   Fail the test if any undefined behavior is found and use abort
##   instead of exit. Using abort is what causes core dumps to be
##   produced.
## * BOOST_TEST_CATCH_SYSTEM_ERRORS=no
##   Normally the boost test library handles SIGABRT and prevents core
##   dumps from being produced.
## This works great with clang and gcc 10.2, but unfortunately not any
## previous gcc.
